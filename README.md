# GlobalKinetic
Assessment project for Global Kinetic
In the CoinJar project  there are a number of classes that implement the ICoin interface namely: 
Penny, Dime, Nickle, Quarter, Half and Dollar. 
I merely included them for ease of testing since guessing the volumes is rather challenging. 
I also implemented another Coin class for testing that any non-valid coins get rejected.
